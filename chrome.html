    <p>Dear President Trump, 
        My name is Saber. I’m 16 years old and I’m living in NYC, I am writing to let you knw my deep worrie
         about the continuing violence in Gaza and the United States continuing to support Israel's military
          actions in the war. The loss of lives and the problems in Gaza is heartbreaking for all the people,
           and the U.S. must take a stand and action to help bring about a peaceful future.
        I  believe that the U.S. has to stop its military aid to Israel’s military. because this support allows
         Israel to continue its genocide in Gaza, which has led to a lot of harm and suffering for the children
          and women in Gaza, if we cut the US  military aid, we can reduce the violence and push for peace in
           the area.
        According to PBS, you are showing strong support for Israel and told them to “ finish the job” in Gaza,
         but you didn’t explain what job and what it doesn’t mean. It seems like you are focusing more on helping
          Israel instead of solving the problems in the region.
             additionally, according to Al Jazeera many in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon they are feelings that
              the US wouldn't tell them one person from Gaza said it “ Trump’s presidency was disastrous for the
               Palestinian cause” while others people think that candidates, will keep supporting Israel war, living 
               little hope for base and Lebanon people believe the US will always support Israel with money or weapons.
             a ceasefire  what is the fight between Gaza and Israel and give the leaders more time to talk and to find
              solution,  in the bast, the casefire help to save the lifes  even if is it for a short time, for example, 
              in 2021 a cesesfire help to stop the fight between Ghaz and Israel.  you could push both side to agree to 
              a ceasesfire and work with countries like Qatar, which often help to mediate.
            Right nowtThe U.S support gaza with food aid but also support israel by  deadly firearms , according to PBS 
            “The State Department says the U.S. will not limit arms transfers to Israel after the country made some progress
             in boosting aid to the territory”. this means that US is supporting Gaza just to keep people alive while giving 
             Israel weapons that hurt people in Gaza   
            I will ask you to stop US military aid to Israel and work on any plan that keeps people alive, PBS said the war 
            in Gaza has caused a “ humanitarian catastrophe” with many families, please  use your leadership to bring fairness 
            and peace to stop more harm and help the people in Gaza.
         Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response on this vital issue.
        </p>
